Bank System
===========

A command line application that allows a user to enter information about his/her bank accounts and then perform transactions on those accounts.


Objective
---------

The goal of this assignment is to create a banking system that allows any number of users to create any number of bank accounts and perform transactions on those bank accounts (including withdrawal, deposits and transfers).

The banking system will also save each user's bank account information to file, so that when they come back their account information will be retrieved automatically.

The banking system will also accrue interest on a user's bank account if it's an account of type savings or retirement.

Extra: The banking system should accrue interest while it's not running. I.e. if I create a savings bank account using your program today, and run it back again tomorrow - never having it run it in between, it should show me that my account has been accruing interest every 10 seconds for the entire time since I started it.
